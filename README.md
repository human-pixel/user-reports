 This one is straightforward and easy to use. A must-have for any Admin that wants to keep track of what's happening on their network! To work its magic on Multisite networks, this plugin requires the [Post Indexer](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/post-indexer/) and [Comment Indexer](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/comment-indexer/) plugins.

## Usage

For help and information on installing plugins you can view our [Installing WordPress Plugins Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/installing-regular-plugins-on-wpmu/).

##### NOTE: This plugin requires that you **install** and **activate** the [Post Indexer Plugin](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/post-indexer/) and the [Comment Indexer Plugin](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/comment-indexer/) before you activate it.

Once you have installed and Network Activated the Plugin you will see a new menu option titled '**Reports**' appear under the **Users** menu on your  Network Admin Dashboard and each of your Site Dashboards.

 Clicking this option will bring you to a special Reports Dashboard:

 Using the Display Options at the top of the screen you can change what is shown in the report on the Dashboard.  The Downloaded File will contain all of the Headings, regardless of this setting.

   Not quite sure what you are looking for?  Just want to see what a particular member is up to?  You can get to a report page directly from their Username in the _Users>All Users_ Menu!  This plugin adds a 'Report' option beneath their Username when you hover:

 And that's it! No-frills no fuss, just good old data at its best!
